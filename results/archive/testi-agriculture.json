    "summary": " The Canadian maple syrup industry accounts for approximately 75% of the world’s maple syrup production. The United States is the second largest world producer accounting for approximately 24% of global production. Despite a cold, late spring in Eastern Canada, the 2019 maple harvest rose by 35% from a year earlier.  Canada is the world’s largest exporter of maple products, with exports valued at $430 million in 2019, up 6% from 2018. Quebec accounted for 97% of Canadian maple product exports for 2019. Maple syrup producers cited losses due to the shutdown of sugar shacks and decreased demand from the foodservice/hospitality industry.  Food available per person is calculated by dividing the domestic disappearance by the Canadian population as of July 1st of the reference year, at the retail level. Does not adjust for losses such as waste and/or spoilage in stores, households, private institutions or restaurants.
