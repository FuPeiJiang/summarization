    "summary": " Report: Indigenous-Owned Exporting Exporting Small and Medium Enterprises in Canada. Report by Audrey Ann Bélanger Baur of the Office of the Chief Economist of Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business.  This report reviews the characteristics of Indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) involved in international trade. Exporting is one of the main characteristics used to evaluate performance since businesses are confronted with numerous challenges when attempting to enter foreign markets. For Indigenous firms operating in a small open economy like Canada, internationalization can be an important strategy for business growth and success.  There is considerable evidence that the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key component to support sustainable economic growth and trade diversification. The size and diversity of Indigenous business in Canada is much larger than is generally understood, with current operations accounting for billions of dollars in annual operations, with thousands of employees.  Collaboration project between Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian Council of Aboriginal Business. It provides a data-driven review of current Indigenous SME activities, combining standard Statistics Canada data and the results of a CCAB national survey of Indigenous businesses. The report explains the current status of Indigenous SMEs engagement in international business.  Statistics Canada’s Survey on Financing and Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, 0.9 percent of exporting SMEs were Indigenous in 2014, i.e. 12.0 percent of Indigenous SMEs exported, compared to 24.4 percent based on the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB) data.  There is currently no evidence of Indigenous business affiliates or subsidiaries abroad. The GATS definition of a service export is broader than the balance of payments (BOP) concept of services trade. The majority of Indigenous businesses do not or have never participated in a business survey, especially if they are located on reserve.  The SDGs encompass the social, environmental and economic dimensions of society and seek to improve the lives of all with no one left behind. The main goals this research contributes to are:  Goal 8 – Decent work and economic growth as Indigenous-owned businesses are an intrinsic part of, and fundamental to, Indigenous communities’ prosperity and agency.  Many recent reports refer to the under-utilized economic potential of Indigenous Peoples and support the hypothesis that Canada is not accurately measuring their economic contributions. Employment recovered to pre-recession levels by 2014 for Indigenous persons living off-reserve, the memory of this period could influence the answers of respondents in 2015. There are more than 630 First Nations communities representing over 50 distinct language and cultural groups across Canada.  In 2016, Indigenous Peoples represented 4.9 percent of the Canadian population. Indigenous entrepreneurs accounted for 2.5 percent of all Canadian entrepreneurs, up from 2.2 percent in 2011. The distinction between self-employed and entrepreneur cannot be made based on the data available.  Over half of Indigenous entrepreneurs operate a business in an industry with export potential, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting and trapping; tourism and recreation; fabricated metal and machinery; clothing and textile; and oil and gas production. Table 1 highlights the tendency of Indigenous Peoples to work as entrepreneurs rather than as employees in export-intensive industries.  From 1996 to 2016, Métis contributed the most to Indigenous self-employment growth growth. They are mainly located in the Western provinces (60 percent) and Ontario (19 percent), and are the most urbanized group of Indigenous Peoples (61 percent) Métes entrepreneurs are more likely to have higher education (32 percent) than their Indigenous counterparts.  The Indigenous entrepreneurial, self-employed with or without paid employees, population nearly doubled from 2001 to 2016, growing from 27,210 to 54,255 according to Census data. Indigenous SME owners tend to be young with just over half (50.9 percent) having managed their business for less than 15 years. Half of Indigenous SMEs reported revenues between $50,000 and $1 million in 2014.  Access to equity and capital can be a challenge for Indigenous businesses for several reasons, including the possible physical distance to financial institutions. Access to business networks is eased through provincial and federal governments’ business services. Social barriers are also considered to be important impediments to business growth for Indigenous persons.  The Indigenous population is the fastest growing sub-population of Canada. Indigenous people contribute an estimated $30 billion to the national economy annually. Data on Indigenous Peoples and their economy is fragmented rendering the development of evidence-supported policies difficult.  A high percentage of Indigenous SMEs sell products and services internationally (24.4 percent), compared to Canadian SMEs46 (11.8 percent) and SMEs in other developed economies. Indigenous communities are typically no larger than 1,000 individuals, it is suspected that Indigenous business strategies may include reaching non-local markets at early stages.  Indigenous SMEs’ international activities are much broader than typically assumed. Less than half of these businesses sell exclusively to the United States, and the other 55.3 percent sell to other international markets. A substantial number of these Indigenous firms are already active in international business, with clear plans to expand operations.  Indigenous business are forging a substantial international presence, with about 14.8 percent reaching international overseas markets. First Nation SMEs have the highest proportion of internationalization of Indigenous SMEs. Inuit SMEs are understandably more locally active, due largely to their remote location.  Indigenous SMEs, based on the CCAB’s 2015 survey, appear to have overall decreasing export propensities with increasing business size. The hypothesis is that business owners would include selling to foreign markets (including the United States) early on in their business strategy compared to non-Indigenous business owners.  Indigenous entrepreneurs are mainly concentrated in professional, scientific and technical services as well as construction. Small and medium sized businesses with 20 to 499 employees compose the majority of administration and support, waste management and remediation services. Agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing; mining, oil and gas extraction; construction; and other services have among the lowest export propensities.  An export-oriented industry is an industry in which exports comprise at least 40 percent of revenues, such as manufacturing; and agriculture, fishing, hunting and trapping. In the Indigenous Business Directory, the largest proportion of Indigenous exporters operates in the professional, scientific and technical services industry.  Most retail trade exporters are First Nation businesses located on reserve. A higher share of the mining and oil and gas extraction SMEs are located off reserve. Aboriginal Economic Development Corporations are corporate entities created by Indigenous communities to represent their business interests in the private market.  Inuit SMEs operate in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry (just under 70 percent) and wholesale trade industry (nearly 80 percent) All Indigenous identities have a significant proportion of businesses in the construction industry. Figure 9 presents the distribution of Indigenous exporters across Canada based on respondents’ self-reported exporting activity.  The export propensity by province and territory presents the provinces with the largest proportion of exporters. Ontario has the highest propensity with over 4 in 10 businesses exporting. The Atlantic Provinces exhibit the third highest export propensity (31.1 percent) although they hold the smallest proportion of Indigenous entrepreneurs of all the provinces (6.9 percent)  In each province, over 90.0 percent of exporters reach the United States, except for British Columbia (83.4 percent) and Quebec (58.8 percent) British Columbia exporters from British Columbia have direct ocean access to Asia through two of Canada’s largest ports. Quebec exporters may also have a lower export propensity towards the US because of the French language. Manitoba has the lowest export propensity of all provinces and Territories.  Indigenous-owned exporters appear to have a negative correlation with business size. Indigenous SMEs located on reserve export at a rate of 26.7 percent according to the data. Indigenous businesses may have an export-oriented strategy early on in their development to access markets with growth potential, which is limited in their home communities.  A positive correlation exists between the level of education attained and the export performance of businesses. Indigenous SMEs are similar to non-Indigenous SMEs in this respect with a greater proportion exporting when the business owner has completed at least some university. Nearly one third of Indigenous SME exporters hold no more than a high school diploma. The use of a business plan is also positively correlated with the growth and potential to export.  In Table 4, less than 40 percent of Indigenous SMEs have a written business plan. In line with entrepreneurship theory, Indigenous SME with a written plan are somewhat more likely to export. Having a business plan is often a requirement to obtain financing from a financial institution or business support from a government program.  Indigenous businesses in Canada reported facing barriers to growth, including access to investment capital, business and professional capacity, the locational disadvantage of working on-reserve. The infrastructure disadvantages encompass localized Indigenous poverty, high costs of transportation, weak or non-existent Internet, inconsistent and expensive electrical supplies, poor levels of education and training among the local population.  Indigenous SMEs with exports to countries other than the U.S. report reliable internet, telephone and other IT technologies as important or highly important obstacles to growth at a higher rate than their counterparts. Access to financing is an important determinant of growth potential for a business as the firm must overcome initial fixed costs to start a business. IP issues are an important concern internationally.  Remoteness is an important characteristic of many Indigenous communities and settlements. This isolation affects individuals’ access to services, such as Internet, electricity and banking services, as well as their transportation opportunities. Indigenous SMEs are seeking to protect their cultural art patterns from low cost foreign replication.  Report attempts to shed light on the performance of Indigenous-owned SMEs using data collected by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. Almost a quarter of Indigenous SMEs engage in export trade. Exporting activities can be used to evaluate commercial performance since a business faces new challenges when attempting to enter foreign markets.  CCAB surveyed Indigenous businesses and built an insightful dataset of 1,101 Indigenous entrepreneurs, including nearly 650 Indigenous SMEs. Statistics Canada conducts a population census every five years. The definition of an SME varies substantially based on the reporting country.  Nonresponse bias of 54.9 percent was adjusted for by weighting the respondents’ answers to the greater population attributes to increase accuracy in the estimates. Table A.1 presents the standard error and confidence intervals of the survey estimates presented in the report.
