    "summary": " Report: Indigenous-Owned Exporting Exporting Small and Medium Enterprises in Canada. Report by Audrey Ann Bélanger Baur of the Office of the Chief Economist of Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business.  This report reviews the characteristics of Indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) involved in international trade. Exporting is one of the main characteristics used to evaluate performance since businesses are confronted with numerous challenges when attempting to enter foreign markets.  There is considerable evidence that the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key component to support sustainable economic growth and trade diversification. At present, relatively little is known about Indigenous individuals and the businesses they manage.  Collaboration project between Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian Council of Aboriginal Business. It provides a data-driven review of current Indigenous SME activities, combining standard Statistics Canada data and the results of a CCAB national survey of Indigenous businesses.  Statistics Canada’s Survey on Financing and Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, 0.9 percent of exporting SMEs were Indigenous in 2014, i.e. 12.0 percent of Indigenous SMEs exported, compared to 24  There is currently no evidence of Indigenous business affiliates or subsidiaries abroad. The GATS definition of a service export is broader than the balance of payments (BOP) concept of services trade. The majority of Indigenous businesses do not or have never  The SDGs encompass the social, environmental and economic dimensions of society and seek to improve the lives of all with no one left behind. The main goals this research contributes to are:  Goal 8 – Decent work and economic growth as  Many recent reports refer to the under-utilized economic potential of Indigenous Peoples and support the hypothesis that Canada is not accurately measuring their economic contributions. Employment recovered to pre-recession levels by 2014 for Indigenous persons living off-reserve  In 2016, Indigenous Peoples represented 4.9 percent of the Canadian population. Indigenous entrepreneurs accounted for 2.5 percent of all Canadian entrepreneurs, up from 2.2 percent in 2011. The distinction between self-employed and entrepreneur cannot be  Over half of Indigenous entrepreneurs operate a business in an industry with export potential, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting and trapping; tourism and recreation; fabricated metal and machinery; clothing and textile; and oil and gas production. Statistics  From 1996 to 2016, Métis contributed the most to Indigenous self-employment growth growth. They are mainly located in the Western provinces (60 percent) and Ontario (19 percent), and are the most urbanized group of Indigenous Peoples  The Indigenous entrepreneurial, self-employed with or without paid employees, population nearly doubled from 2001 to 2016, growing from 27,210 to 54,255 according to Census data. Half of Indigenous SMEs reported revenues between $50,000  Access to equity and capital can be a challenge for Indigenous businesses for several reasons, including the possible physical distance to financial institutions. Access to business networks is eased through provincial and federal governments’ business services. Social barriers are also considered to  The Indigenous population is the fastest growing sub-population of Canada. Indigenous people contribute an estimated $30 billion to the national economy annually. Data on Indigenous Peoples and their economy is fragmented rendering the development of evidence-supported policies difficult.  A high percentage of Indigenous SMEs sell products and services internationally (24.4 percent), compared to Canadian SMEs46 (11.8 percent) and SMEs in other developed economies. Factors other than productivity could explain the high export  Indigenous SMEs’ international activities are much broader than typically assumed. Less than half of these businesses sell exclusively to the United States, and the other 55.3 percent sell to other international markets. The most popular destination market of Indigenous  Indigenous business are forging a substantial international presence, with about 14.8 percent reaching international overseas markets. First Nation SMEs have the highest proportion of internationalization of Indigenous SMEs, closely followed by Métis and finally Inuit SM  Indigenous SMEs, based on the CCAB’s 2015 survey, appear to have overall decreasing export propensities with increasing business size. The hypothesis is that business owners would include selling to foreign markets (including the United States)  Statistics Canada: Indigenous entrepreneurs are mainly concentrated in professional, scientific and technical services as well as construction. Small and medium sized businesses with 20 to 499 employees compose the majority of administration and support, waste management and remediation services (NAICS  An export-oriented industry is an industry in which exports comprise at least 40 percent of revenues, such as manufacturing; and agriculture, fishing, hunting and trapping. In the Indigenous Business Directory, the largest proportion of Indigenous exporters operates in  Most retail trade exporters are First Nation businesses located on reserve. A higher share of the mining and oil and gas extraction SMEs are located off reserve. Aboriginal Economic Development Corporations (AEDCs) are corporate entities created by Indigenous  Inuit SMEs operate in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry (just under 70 percent) and wholesale trade industry (nearly 80 percent) All Indigenous identities have a significant proportion of businesses in the construction industry. Figure 9 presents  The export propensity by province and territory presents the provinces with the largest proportion of exporters. Ontario has the highest propensity with over 4 in 10 businesses exporting. The Atlantic Provinces exhibit the third highest export propensity (31.1 percent  In each province, over 90.0 percent of exporters reach the United States, except for British Columbia (83.4 percent) and Quebec (58.8 percent) British Columbia has direct ocean access to Asia through two of Canada  Indigenous-owned exporters appear to have a negative correlation with business size. Indigenous SMEs located on reserve export at a rate of 26.7 percent according to the data. Indigenous businesses may have an export-oriented strategy early on in  A positive correlation exists between the level of education attained and the export performance of businesses. Indigenous SMEs are similar to non-Indigenous SMEs in this respect with a greater proportion exporting when the business owner has completed at least some university  In Table 4, less than 40 percent of Indigenous SMEs have a written business plan. Table 4 shows that 3 in 10 Indigenous entrepreneurs have a formal business plan. Smaller businesses, notably those without employees, are less likely to have  Indigenous businesses in Canada reported facing barriers to growth, including access to investment capital, business and professional capacity, the locational disadvantage of working on-reserve, high community demands on Indigenous business leaders, small local market size, and a  Indigenous SMEs with exports to countries other than the U.S. report reliable internet, telephone and other IT technologies as important or highly important obstacles to growth at a higher rate than their counterparts. Access to financing is an important determinant  Remoteness is an important characteristic of many Indigenous communities and settlements. Some communities may be physically accessible only three weeks in an entire year. Climate change exacerbates these issues in the North by thawing permafrost and melting ice  Report attempts to shed light on the performance of Indigenous-owned SMEs using data collected by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. Almost a quarter of Indigenous SMEs engage in export trade. Exporting activities can be used to evaluate commercial performance  CCAB surveyed Indigenous businesses and built an insightful dataset of 1,101 Indigenous entrepreneurs, including nearly 650 Indigenous SMEs. Statistics Canada conducts a population census every five years. The definition of an SME varies substantially based on the reporting country  Nonresponse bias of 54.9 percent was adjusted for by weighting the respondents’ answers to the greater population attributes to increase accuracy in the estimates. The data was calibrated according to selected population parameters of self-employed Indigenous individuals.
