The unprecedented economic situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for trusted information.  Statistics Canada is developing an experimental method for examining family weekly income patterns during the pandemic. The approach integrates weekly earnings available from the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS) together with information specific to government transfers including special COVID-19  Several one-time increases to payments under various means-tested programs were also introduced during the pandemic. Disposable income increased 10.8% in the second quarter due to the decline in wages and salaries being more than offset by  Income for seniors is largely composed of private pension income, Canada and Quebec Pension Plan income, Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits. Fullâ€‘time members of the Canadian Armed Forces are also excluded from the LFS sample.  Chart 1 shows benchmark estimates of aggregate CERB benefits in each LFS reference week.

The share of persons in non-senior, non-self-employed families with below-LIM weekly earnings rose from 26% in February to  Over the course of the pandemic, the LFS collection was adapted by replacing face-to-face interviews by telephone interviews, resulting in a lower response rate. No study has been completed regarding the effects of declining LFS response rates"
