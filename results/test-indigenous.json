    "summary": " Study of microorganisms in natural waters involve enumeration as a general index of activity and as a measurement of bacteria in water and sediments. Cultural methods are most commonly used even though they often yield only a small percentage of the microorganisms present.  This section deals with specific technical procedures and does not include isolation techniques and specific media. The techniques to be described can be applied to water, wastewater, sludge or sediment samples. The choice of technique depends on several factors, including the physical and chemical characteristics of the water.  The quality of results obtained from any test can be defined in terms of accuracy; precision; and limit of detection. Errors in the accuracy, the difference between the true and the actual measured values of results can be quantitative or qualitative. Some errors are independent of the enumeration procedure.  Random distribution of microorganisms in a sample causes imprecision in the results. With bacterial colony-count procedures, precision increases as the number of bacterial colonies increases. The limit of detection depends on the volume of the sample actually examined.  Microorganisms are strict aerobes and their detection may be carried out by the broth culture surface-spread or membrane-filtration methods. Certain microorganisms cannot withstand thermal shocks, e.g. 44°C, and thus, elevated temperatures should therefore be avoided for their enumeration. Chlorinated or disinfected drinking water may contain residual chemical activity and inhibit bacterial growth in culture media.  Untreated or improperly treated drinking water may contain microorganisms that are pathogenic. Membrane filtration can overcome such disadvantages.  The concentrated medium used in the test is prepared from the following, and the chemicals are dissolved into the distilled or dechlorinated tap water with stirring.  Non-refrigerated samples should be tested as soon as possible. In the laboratory, use either a sterile graduated cylinder to measure the required water volume prior to dispensing into the appropriate H28 paper strip bottle. If there is any blackening of the paper strip in the sample water, the test is positive and must be reported immediately.  Tubes can now be loosely capped and autoclaved for 15 minutes at 115°C. Or the loosely capped tubes can be placed in a hot air oven at 160°C for 60 minutes to sterilize and dry. If the tube becomes positive (black colouration) this suggests the presence of at least 10 indicator bacteria per 100 mL.  Presence-Absence (P/A) test can test for other indicators of poor water quality, including Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, pseudomonas, Clostridia, Aeromonas and staphylococci. The medium used in this test is prepared from the following: Bacto beef extract. Three times the above ingredients are weighed out and added to one litre of distilled or dechlorinated tap water.  Presence-Absence (PIA) Test Procedure for each sample, use either or both a 20. mL sample testing bottle (50 mL size) and/or 100. mL samples. Label each bottle with the sample number and date, or name of location such as home, facility, etc.  ColiPlateTM-400 enables quantification of coliforms and E.coli densities ranging from <3 to 2400 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL in a single test without dilution. Coliplate contains selective media to provide nutrients to stimulate the growth of Coliforms. Media also contains inducers and chromogenic/fluorogenic substrates. The ColiPIate can be used to confirm H28 paper strip results.  ColiPlateTM-4OO Two Strip Quick Screening Procedure. 6 water samples can be tested with one 96 well microplate. Incubate at 35°C for 20-24 hours. Count the number of wells that turned blue/green. Refer to 16 well Microplatem- 400 MPN Table to determine the Most Probable Number for Total Coliforms in 100 mL sample.  The number of positive findings resulting from multiple-portion decimental dilution23l planting should be computed as the combination of positives and recorded in terms of the Most Probable Number (MPN) MostMPN procedures have confinnatioh requirements whichiare-specificf for each group of organisms being enumerated.  Fecal coliforms are defined as gram-negative, non-spore forming bacilli which are cytochrome oxidase negative and ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas at 44.5° i O.2°C within 24 hours. Tubes should be of sufficient capacity to contain 1 mL inoculum + 10 mL single—strength broth and 10. mL 2x broth. pH of medium should be approximately 6.9 after autoclave sterilization, 104 kPa/20 min. (121°) Medium may be stored at least 30 days at 2 to 4°.  The genus Escherichia is composed of motile or non-motile bacteria that conform to the definitions of the family Enterobacten’acae and the tribe Eschen’chieae. E. coli are gram negative, oxidase negative bacteria which usually ferment lactose rapidly. When lactose is utilized, acid and gas are usually produced with 24 hours at 44.5°C.  A QA program is the integration of intralaboratory and interlaboratory QC, standardized methods, written QA guidelines, standard reference materials, training courses and on-site laboratory evaluations. The accuracy and reliability of analytical results cannot be guaranteed if the standard operating procedures of the laboratory do not include an effective, ongoing QC program.  The correct time and temperature for autoclave sterilization of frequently used materials and the recommended specifications for laboratory pure water are given in Tables 2 and 3.  The best available materials and techniques in media preparation, storage and application should be used. Commercially prepared media are preferable32whenever available, but may vary in quality among manufacturers. Not more than a one-year supply of media should be ordered at one time. Media that are caked, discoloured, or show deterioration must be discarded.  Membrane filters and absorbent pads must be resistant to degradation by sterilization at 121°C for 10 minutes. Equipment, such as incubators, waterbaths, hot air ovens, refrigerators, freezers, balances, pH meters, ion exchange units, and stills must be routinely monitored and services.  An analytical balance with a sensitivity of 1 mg or less at 10 9 load should be used for weighing 2 g or less. For larger quantities, a balance with accuracy of 50 mg at 150 9 load. Water Deionizer Monitor water for conductance daily. Monitor trace metals and other toxic or nutritive compounds annually.  At least ten colonies used in computing the final density are picked into fermentation or biochemical media and tested to verify that they are the target organisms. Verification is performed at least monthly. Table 7 (next page) gives examples of test cultures for the commonly used parameters.  TatumeI/a has polar flagella; susceptible to penicillin; poor grower, better at 25°C. Xenorhabdus luminescens is isolated from nematodes only. Yersinia* aldovae is isolated. from humans, respiratory tract, urine, blood, wounds, wounds. Y. rucken'i not found kristensenii in humans, cause of \"red mouth\" disease of fish.
