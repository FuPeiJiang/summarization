    "summary": " The Canadian Forum on Civil Justice is a national not-for-profit organization dedicated to civil justice reform and access to justice research and advocacy. The Cost of Justice project (2011-2017) examines the social and economic costs of Canada’s justice system. Almost half of Canadians over 18 will experience at least one civil or family justice problem over any given three-year period.  Almost half (48.4%) of Canadians over 18 will experience at least one civil or family justice problem over any given three-year period. Canada has one of the best legal systems in the world: independent judges, well-trained lawyers, predictable laws, and an open court process. Unfortunately, most Canadians cannot afford to use it. Getting legal help is expensive. Average hourly legal fees can amount to hundreds of dollars.  The Canadian Forum on Civil Justice conducted a national legal-problems survey that examines everyday legal problems experienced by the Canadian public. The “Everyday Legal Problems and the Cost of Justice in Canada” survey is the first Canadian study of its kind to ask the public what legal problems cost.  The “Everyday Legal Problems and the Cost of Justice” survey is based on a national random sample of over 3,000 Canadians. The Institute for Social Research at York University conducted the telephone interviews between September 2013 and May 2014. It is the first legal problems survey in Canada to ask extensive questions about the  monetary  costs associated with experiencing everyday legal problems.  Survey was accurate within a 1.8% margin of error. The sample completion rate was 42%, which is a typical – and certainly substantial – rate by industry standards. Respondents were asked if within three years of the interview they had experienced any problems from a list of 84 specific problem scenarios, each one carefully worded to ensure that the issue had legal content. For purposes of the survey, respondents were not expected to recognize the legal implications of the problems.  This approach follows the definition of a justiciable event developed by Hazel Genn in her Paths to Justice study. The data used in this report is weighted to correct for unequal probabilities of selection. The weights ensure that the proportion of cases in each province, by household size (for example one, two, three, etc. adult households) and by ten different age and gender categories match those of the  Canadian population.  An everyday legal problem is a problem arising out of the normal activities of people’s daily lives that has a legal aspect and has a potential legal solution. SPSS with the variable “weight_to_pop”  will produce  nearly identical  results  for  point  estimates but  incorrect  but incorrect   results.  The crisis has been recognized in several recent national reports. 54.3% of respondents indicated that a legal problem made daily life “extremely’, “very”, or “somewhat” difficult. Of those we surveyed, 30% experienced two or more legal problems. Within a three-year period, approximately 11.4 million adult Canadians will experience at least one everyday legal problem.  The study provided information on a number of issues relating to the public’s use of the justice system. Within any given three-year period, adult Canadians experience approximately 35,745,000 separate everyday legal problems. Of the 1,321 respondents who reported on problems, 761 of them reported on two different problems, while the remaining 560 reported on a single problem.  Few people with legal problems use the formal legal system to resolve their problems. 95% of people try to do something about their legal problems. Of those who attempted to solve their problems, only 5% took no action to resolve the problem.  Canadians have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their options for resolving legal problems. One in five indicated that cost was a factor in their decision not to take action. On the positive side, many respondents reported favourably about various sources of help.  Some Canadians do not view the justice system as fair, accessible or reflective of them or their needs. The survey included specific questions on what everyday legal problems cost individuals and the state, on a national scale.  Everyday legal problems can result in costs to the basic security of the person in terms of loss of employment or housing. They can also cost the state as the impacts of experiencing legal problems are passed on to publicly funded services and programs by way of increased health care costs, employment insurance, social services and housing subsidies. In Canada, this totals approximately $23 billion over three years.  On an annual basis, Canadians spend just over $7.7 billion to deal with everyday legal problems. A small number of outliers – those who reported spending $100,000 or in some cases much more to address their problem – were excluded from these calculations.  Lawyers’ fees are, perhaps  unsurprisingly, the most often cited expense. Transportation costs are a close second. People often required to travel for appointments or appearances at courts or tribunals – and the cost, for some, can be considerable.  Dealing with legal problems causes stress and financial strain for the public – even for people who have adequate resources. Legal  problems are often more challenging for those with fewer resources. Over half (51%) of people who reported having a legal problem experienced stress or emotional difficulty as a direct consequence of having that problem. We estimate that  annual costs related to receiving  social assistance, a loss of employment, and physical and mental health issues – all as  a direct result of  of legal problems – are added  to the state.  Everyday legal problems represent major annual costs to the state, amounting to a combined total of approximately $800 million. Follow up reports will be forthcoming through the Canadian Forum on Civil Justice and will be available on the Forum’s website.  In the survey, respondents were asked if, as a result of these problems, they accessed the health care system more frequently than normal. Everyday legal problems cost the state an estimated $450 million annually in additional employment insurance payments. The $101 million, however, is still very likely on the low end of actual spending on these services.  Canadians used the health care system an estimated 5,232,582 times over the  three-year  reference period – or 1,744,194 more visits annually – as a direct consequence of an everyday legal problem. Approximately  40%  of  Canadians  on  average  who  reported experiencing a high level of stress or emotional problems as a consequence of a legal problem accessed the system one or more times in addition to their normal usage.  Approximately 40% of Canadians who reported experiencing a high level of stress or emotional problems as a consequence of a legal problem accessed the health care system one or more times in addition to their normal usage. An average  cost of a physician visit  is  $58.15, including office visits, consultations, surgeries and diagnostic tests. An estimated 2.7% (100,839) of Canadians lose their housing every year as a direct  consequence  of a  legal problem.  An estimated 2.7% (100,839) of Canadians lose their housing every year as a direct consequence of a legal problem. The results are significant and should be of interest to all members of the justice community. We are pleased to present these findings from the first  major national legal needs study done in Canada in a number of years.  Early indications from the data suggest that problems of discrimination are on the rise. Further reports (in progress) will explore other areas of specific interest and concern.  We hope that the results of this study will help to inform important public discussions around access to justice and our collective legal wellbeing.
