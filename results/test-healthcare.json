    "summary": " You may not reproduce materials in this publication, in whole or in part, for the purposes of commercial redistribution without prior written permission from Environment and Climate Change Canada's copyright administrator. To obtain permission to reproduce Government of Canada materials for commercial purposes, apply for Crown Copyright Clearance.  The Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring  Network (CABIN) provides the tools necessary to conduct consistent and scientifically credible biological assessments of freshwater. Each organization participating in the CABIN program should implement the prescribed quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) procedures. This ensures precision, accuracy, completeness, comparability, and representativeness of the data.  Health and safety requirements and regulations may vary between jurisdictions and projects. Taxonomic services section outlines expectations of taxonomic laboratories working on CABIN projects. Services required from a taxonomy laboratory are as follows.  CABIN recommends the use of certified taxonomists. The Society for Freshwater Science or SFS offers a Taxonomic Certification Program for family and genus level taxonomy.  Formalin is a traditional preservative that uses dilute formaldehyde in an aqueous solution. Formalin preserved samples can become acidic and break down organisms in the sample. Preserved samples should be shipped to the taxonomic laboratory as soon as possible. The optimal  final  concentration for preservation  in the  field is 50%.  All samples and sample residues (sorted and unsorted) should be returned to the project authority and shipped in 70% ethanol. CABIN recommends keeping  all samples from reference sites for 10 years, until models for the region are completed and published.  Subsampling for CABIN river, stream and wetland samples is done with a Marchant Box. A minimum count of 300 individuals and a minimum of  5  subsamples is required. Lake samples are typically not  subsampled since the abundance of organisms from a single sample is usually less than 300.  The subsampling and sorting protocol using a Marchant Box is outlined below. Table 2 lists essential materials and equipment for sample subsampled and sorting. The Marchant box contains a sieve (400 micron or less)  There must be at least 5 cells (5% of the sample) sorted and identified, no matter the organism count. Certain taxa are not used in the CABIN analysis and are not included in the 300 count. Ostracoda Taxa can be found in extremely high numbers and bias a sample. Benthic   taxa  not adequately sampled using a 400 um kicknet.  Wetlands now have their own set of CABIN standardized methods for collection of benthic invertebrates. Subsampling with the Marchant Box may prove difficult, even with all larger debris removed. Large zooplankton (Copepoda, Ostracoda, Cladocera) are an important  and  abundant group in wetland communities.  Quality control audits should be carried out on a regular basis to establish a standard sorting efficiency. The sorting auditing protocol is as follows: Randomly select samples to be audited. Someone other than the original sorter should select samples. Re-sort the residue from 10% of the project samples (minimum of 3) Record the number of organisms found in each sample residue. Calculate %SE for each sample using the equation: 100*#1%FoundOrganismsTotalMissedOrganismsSE Total organisms found includes the original  count and the number  found from the re-sorting of the residue.  Table 5.1 lists the minimum equipment required for taxonomic identifications and for data entry into the CABIN Database. Nomenclature should conform to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), available on the  United States home page http://www.itis.gov or  on the Canadian partner home page   .  All samples in the project should be re-sorted if:  a) the sorting efficiency rate is ≤ 95% OR b) an entire class of organisms is overlooked. The minimum level of identification required (where possible) is family level. CABIN uses ITIS as the standard for taxonomic nomenclature.  The project authority randomly selects samples and someone other than the original taxonomist should perform audits. There are several types of errors related to taxonomy including: misidentification, enumeration and questionable taxonomic resolution. Errors could be the result of operational factors; poor lighting, poor microscope, poor training and poor counting protocols.  If the identification error rate is 5%, the project should be re-identified by someone other than the original taxonomist. All  third  party results should be reported in the QC audit report.  CABIN Database houses national data with contributions of taxonomic information from many laboratories. Supplemental information (such as  special  species  designations) gathered during the identification  process are not  accepted  in the  database (Appendix B) Taxonomists can enter data directly into the database provided they are trained.  Voucher specimens are required by the National CABIN Laboratory to verify the identification of any taxa that are new to the database. Specimens in a reference collection are to be preserved in 70% ethanol and stored in sealed vials with appropriate labels. The required information for each label and for the spreadsheet is listed below.  Each vial should be labeled and specimens should be accompanied by a spreadsheet detailing the information provided on the specimen labels. Voucher specimens will be verified in the National CABIN Laboratory by the National Taxonomist. Any taxa that  require  expert opinion will be sent to the appropriate recognized expert.  An average sorting efficiency over 95% should be achieved on 10% of samples or a minimum of 3 samples in a project. The National CABIN Laboratory only performs audits on samples collected as part of reference model development. The QAQC audits do not replace the QC requirement of 10% re-identification by a third party.  National CABIN Laboratory houses a physical National Reference Collection and digital catalogue. The digital catalogue contains multiple images of a specimen and important features of its group. Routine audits are performed to  ensure that the data conform to standard naming conventions (Appendix B) Errors are discussed with the project authority and database manager.  Some taxa  are small and not adequately sampled using a 400-meter kicknet. Some of these taxa can be found in extremely high numbers and can bias a sample. Waterborne samples still require zooplankton identification (refer to section 4.2)  Appendix B: Errors in taxonomic nomenclature. Table B.1: Unacceptable naming conventions. Table A/B: The following is adapted from Rogers, D.C., A. Richards and Mouton et al.  The CABIN Database cannot distinguish between valid (published) slash taxa and taxonomic opinion. Elevate any taxa that cannot be identified with certainty to the next higher level. Slash taxa designations can be entered into notes section of the data entry sheet or communicated on bench sheets.  The previous name will be used as a default until ITIS is updated. CABIN advises that the taxon be entered as the last reported name as listed in ITIS and the ‘new’ name be recorded in the notes section.  Taxonomy data cannot be uploaded if site visit and sample information is not entered into the CABIN Database. Samples from reference sites may be used  in  model development and therefore used by others in the network. Ten percent of reference samples or 3 per 32 projects should be sent to the National. Laboratory for QAQC audits on sorting efficiency and taxonomic errors.  CABIN Laboratory does not require reference collections for each project. A collection should only be requested as part of the contract with the taxonomist if the project authority wishes to have such a collection.  The National CABIN Laboratory will conduct audits on 10% of all reference and potential reference samples (or a minimum of 3) in a project. Samples received from the taxonomist or project authority will be audited for sorting efficiency (SE) and identification errors (IE) Only identification errors will count towards the %IE."
