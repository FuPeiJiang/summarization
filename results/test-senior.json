    "summary": " The Old Age Security (OAS) program is the first pillar of Canada’s retirement income system. This paper examines the take-up of OAS benefits, among those who are eligible, and the financial situation of beneficiaries of  In July 2015, the OAS pension provided benefits to 5.6 million seniors with the full basic pension amounting to $564.87 per month (or about $6,800 per year) Eligibility for the O  Seniors living outside Canada need a minimum of 20 years of residence in Canada after age 18 to receive the OAS pension outside the country. In July 2015, the GIS was paid to 1.7 million low-income seniors and  GIS benefits are suspended after six months outside the country. GIS and Allowance benefits are determined using net income. Eligibility for the Allowances is also based on family income. Benefits paid under the OAS program are,  Since April 2013, an automatic enrolment process has been introduced, eliminating the need for many seniors to apply for the OAS pension. Budget 2016 announced an increase to the GIS top-up of single seniors, effective in July 2016  Non-permanent residents such as refugee claimants, holders of work or study permits, and members of their families living with them were excluded from the sample. The survey also excludes persons living in institutional collective dwellings such as hospitals, nursing homes  EI and QPIP contributions do not include contributions for self-employment income. GIS and Allowances benefits from July 2009 to June 2010 are based on income in 2008. 2010 income must be used to determine eligibility to receive the  In reality, the amount of the OAS pension is based on years of residence in Canada (after reaching 18 years of age) when the pension begins. In July 2015, fewer than 2% of OAS beneficiaries were benefiting from an  The number of people receiving the OAS pension is underestimated in the NHS (compared to OAS administrative data) The NHS does not include people living in nursing homes and hospitals, while the Census includes these people. Of the 4.  The OAS Recovery Tax is considered a tax measure. The take-up rate of the OAS pension among eligible seniors was 96.9% in 2010. Table 3A compares take-ups for different groups and indicates if differences in  Take-up of the OAS pension estimated in this paper is similar to the take-up estimate for tax-filers using LAD data.

Table shows that differences in take-ups are statistically  The take-up rate of the GIS among eligible seniors was 89.1% in 2010; however almost all (99.4%) GIS-eligible seniors received the OAS pension. Table 4A shows that GIS take  Table 4B shows that GIS take-up decreases with income, reaching more effectively seniors who need it more. GIS takes-up was 96% for those with less than $10,000 in family income from sources other than  GIS take-up was higher among those living in subsidized dwellings and those with no diploma of any kind. Service Canada has been reaching out to seniors to ensure they are aware of the GIS and that eligible seniors apply for it.  GIS take-up was 3 to 5 percentage points higher in Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Quebec (3 of the 4 provinces where seniors have the lowest average income) Take-up rates were not significantly different for Aboriginals (both  Allowances take-up rate was 78% for those with $10,000 to $15,000 in income from other sources. People with less than a high school diploma had a higher number of people applying for the Allowances.  There is a significant vulnerable population among 60-64 year olds. Over 85% of Allowances recipients have individual income below $25,000. Allowances benefits amounted to $5,600 and represented almost 50% of individual income.  As presented previously, Allowances benefits received in 2010 are based on income in 2008 and 2009. For 2010 benefits, the family income threshold was $29,904 for married or common-law couples and $21,768 for wid  The Allowances are aimed at two groups of 60-64 year olds: widows and spouses of seniors (over 65 years old) There is a significant vulnerable population among both groups. Table 6C shows that the prevalence is higher among  2011 National Household Survey (sample of 407,995 people aged 60-64 years old) Among Allowance recipients, many widows and spouses of seniors are financially vulnerable, and the Allowances make a significant contribution to helping recipients financially.  Allowance for the Survivor recipients had diverse sources of income. 60% lived in households with income below $25,000. Almost 80% of them had income from the CPP or the QPP. Almost 90% of Allowance  Take-up rates of the Allowances also decrease with income, with higher take-up among seniors who need it most. There is a significant vulnerable population among 60-64 year olds, in particular, among widows or widowers  On average, Allowances benefits amounted to $5,600 and represented almost 50% of individual income. Over 85% of Allowances recipients have individual income below $25,000, with a mean income of $16,000."
